# Predicting Start-Up Profit Using Multi-Linear Regression
----

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a multi-linear regression model to predict the profit of a start-up based on various financial and regional features, including R&D spending, administrative expenses, marketing spending, and location. The goal is to create an interpretable model that provides insights into the impact of different types of spending on profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on 50 start-ups, with the following features:
- `R&D Spend`: Spending on research and development.
- `Administration`: Spending on administrative expenses.
- `Marketing Spend`: Spending on marketing.
- `State`: The state where the start-up is located (New York, California, or Florida).
- `Profit`: The profit generated by the start-up (target variable).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset.
  - `StartUpProfits.csv`: The dataset used for this project.
- `plots/`: Folder containing all generated plots for analysis.
  - `actual_vs_predicted_profit.png`: Plot showing actual vs. predicted profit values.
  - `correlation_matrix_heatmap.png`: Heatmap of feature correlations.
  - `residuals_histogram.png`: Histogram of residuals to assess normality.
  - `residuals_vs_predicted_profit.png`: Scatter plot of residuals vs. predicted profit.
  - `scatter_plots.png`: Scatter plots of features vs. profit.
- `Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete code for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `LinearRegression.py`: Python script containing the core code for building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd StartUpProfitPrediction
   ```
3. Install the required libraries
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place the dataset (`StartUpProfits.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Linear_Regression.ipynb`) for a step-by-step analysis and model building process.
3. Alternatively, you can execute `LinearRegression.py` to perform the analysis and model building without the notebook interface.
4. The generated plots will be saved in the `plots/` folder.

## Results
- The final multi-linear regression model achieved an RÂ² score of approximately 0.90, indicating strong predictive performance.
- Key insights:
  - R&D spending has the strongest positive impact on profit.
  - Marketing spending also contributes to profit, though with more variability.
  - Administrative expenses and location showed weaker correlations with profit.
